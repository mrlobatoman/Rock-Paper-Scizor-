## Reflections

- Navigating through 2 classes and linking the appropriate functions was confusing at times. 

- CSS and specifically the responsiveness to the view port continues to be a challenge of mine.

- I had some issues with a function that led me to troubleshoot through dev tools. It was a long process,  
but there was some valuable lessons in figuring out what was happening with this particular function. 

- Observing the changes to the data model and how the DOM was responding was helpful and aided in my  
learning of code.
